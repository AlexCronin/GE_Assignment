# Proposal:
My project will be a procedurally generated world. I intend to create the terrain of the planet as well vegetation / plants.
I will alter the colour and viual effects of the terrain based on the music that is playing.

## References

My planets will take inspiration from "No Man's Sky" which is a popular game that uses procedural generation.
