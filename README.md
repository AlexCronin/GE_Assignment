# Games Engine 1 Assignment

I created my own mesh using the knowledges from the exmaples in class.
The TerrainGen.cs file contains the ocde used to create each tile.
The height of the terrain is adjusted by changing the "y" position of each vertext. 

The terrain is generated infinitely using Bryan Duggans code.

# Proposal:
My project will be a procedurally generated world. I intend to create the terrain of the planet as well vegetation / plants.
I will alter the colour and viual effects of the terrain based on the music that is playing.

## References

My planets will take inspiration from "No Man's Sky" which is a popular game that uses procedural generation.
